# GraphCursorPy

**GraphCursorPy** is a Python toolkit for processing PKP precursors based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and related seismic methods.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- GNN-based multistation detection of PKP precursors
- Estimation of scatterer locations and relative strengths
- Built-in example data and precomputed travel-time tables for quick testing
